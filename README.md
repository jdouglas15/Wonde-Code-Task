Slight deviation from the spec but I've came at this more from a school principle point of view. They can view their staff members, their classes and their students in those classes. They are also able to view any classes that the teacher has today.Some of the key areas are:
- Using an API to get staff members
- Displaying staff members info in a table
- Some minor pagination
- Filter table by removing staff members who don't have classes using the switch
- Using components and passing objects through them to get staff members classes
- Using API to get student data in a particular class in a table
- Using API and filters to show any classes a teacher as today (Future work would involve using a datepicker or day changers to allow a user to flick between days)

My router.js file wasn't playing ball, it was something to do with my build and I couldn't figure it out. So to avoid insanity I just used components that start on the app.vue file. It's not perfect or ideal but hopefully you get the picture
