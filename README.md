Slight deviation from the spec but I've came at this more from a school principle point of view. Some of the key areas are:
- Using an API to get staff members
- Displaying staff members info in a table
- Some minor pagination
- Filter table by removing staff members who don't have classes
- Using components and passing objects through them to get staff members classes
- Using API to get student data in a particular class in a table
